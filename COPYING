Gloranthan-Runes: remapped https://www.glorantha.com/docs/glorantha-core-rune-font/
Note:
I have relocated the chars to the private use area of unicode, but not
modified them. I don't know if this counts as "modifying the font", IANAL.
If you want to use this remapping of the font rather then the original
You will have to come to your own conclusion about the legality thereof.
